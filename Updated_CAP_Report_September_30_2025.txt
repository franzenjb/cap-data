Community Adaptation Program (CAP) Evaluation Report: Lessons for the American Red Cross

Prepared for American Red Cross Leadership
September 30, 2025

I. Executive Summary

The Community Adaptation Program (CAP) is a vital initiative designed to strengthen the American Red Cross (ARC) by expanding disaster capacity and building long-term community resilience. Since its inception in 2022, CAP has demonstrably added value across four critical areas: quality of service, cost containment, speed of aid delivery, and scalability potential. This comprehensive evaluation, incorporating both quantitative data and extensive qualitative insights from over 150 key informant interviews for Disaster Relief Operations (DROs) alone, including 12 community stakeholder interviews from recent disasters (Hurricanes Debby, Helene, Milton, and California Wildfires), aims to provide senior leadership with a clear, impactful, and actionable understanding of CAP's operational and strategic worth to inform decisions beyond FY27.

Key Findings:

Quality of Service: CAP partners have demonstrably improved the quality of Red Cross disaster services by expanding access, ensuring cultural appropriateness, and accelerating aid delivery, which enhances client dignity and uptake. A key strength is reaching rural and underserved "invisible populations"—such as migrant workers, elderly caregivers, and the Hispanic population—that are often overlooked by traditional response channels. Partners act as trusted local messengers, leveraging established relationships to connect with these communities.

Service quality is enhanced through culturally appropriate resources, including:
• Adapted Meals: In Latino and farming communities, partners provided culturally sensitive foods like rice and beans when standard Red Cross meals were not appropriate, and at other events, they facilitated food selections that incentivized attendance.
• Bilingual Support: Partners offered crucial translation services, enabling full conversations with Spanish-speaking community members where Red Cross staff sometimes lacked language capacity.
• Trusted Messengers: In communities struggling with low literacy or poor internet connectivity, partners worked through trusted local leaders like pastors to personalize assistance and set up appointments, overcoming challenges with QR code sign-ups.

These tailored approaches have led to measurably higher client uptake and faster assistance. For example, in Terrebonne Parish during Hurricane Francine (DR 207-25), CAP's involvement led to a 93% Immediate Assistance (IA) completion rate, significantly higher than the overall 67% rate for selected communities in that disaster. Similarly, in the South Texas Floods (DR 503-25), CAP outreach contributed to a 58.3% IA pick-up rate, compared to the nationwide average of 51%. Recent analysis from Hurricanes Debby, Helene, and Milton further confirms that CAP-supported resilience hubs and bilingual outreach expanded reach into previously overlooked populations.

Cost Containment (ROI): The Community Adaptation Program (CAP) has demonstrably reduced Red Cross operational costs through partner contributions of in-kind donations and services that the Red Cross would otherwise have to fund. The CAP team meticulously tracks and monetizes these contributions, which include feeding, distribution of emergency supplies (DES), facilities, and volunteer efforts, using methodologies consistent with Red Cross data capture (e.g., 5266). The analysis focuses on the value-added contributions from partners by excluding CAP staff salaries and enhancements from the cost containment calculation itself.

Key examples of these cost savings include:
• Feeding Assistance: Partners provide hot meals and food supplies, significantly offsetting Red Cross feeding expenses. During DR 540-25 (Tennessee Tornados), one DRO staff member reported, "I did not pay a dime for feeding," as local communities and CAP partners covered all associated costs.
• Volunteer Mobilization: Partners mobilize their own local volunteers for tasks like damage assessment, distribution, and shelter shifts, reducing the need for the Red Cross to deploy its own staff.
• Facilities and Equipment: Partners provide donated spaces for Immediate Assistance (IA) centers or cooling stations, eliminating facility rental costs. They also leverage their own resources, like donated box trucks, for supply distribution.
• Supply Distribution: Partners not only distribute supplies but sometimes purchase them as well, supplementing the resources coming from Red Cross national headquarters.

Quantitatively, the program has generated over $1.6 million ($1,606,305) in total cost containment across multiple Disaster Relief Operations (DROs). This represents a 28.3% Return on Investment (ROI) on the $5,669,272 invested in partner enhancements. During Hurricane Francine (DR 207-25) alone, nearly $250,000 in cost containment was tracked, comprising $131,937 in direct services and $111,300 in volunteer contributions. In DR 540-25 (Tennessee Tornados), leadership estimated that partner contributions offset $80,000 to $100,000 in immediate costs. Additional cost savings were documented in California Wildfire responses and Hurricane Debby operations, where pre-positioned assets (generators, refrigeration units, vehicles) enabled sustained operations without Red Cross capital expenditures.

It is important to note that these figures may be conservative, as interviewees acknowledged "reporting shortfalls" due to the dynamic nature of disaster response, suggesting actual cost savings could be even higher.

Speed of Delivery: A consistent and powerful finding across multiple Disaster Relief Operations (DROs) is the Community Adaptation Program's (CAP) ability to remarkably accelerate service delivery, often allowing partners to respond more quickly than centralized Red Cross operations. This speed is a direct result of pre-existing "blue-sky" relationships, local readiness, pre-positioned assets, and the "transference of trust" built before a disaster strikes.

Partners are frequently the "first on the ground—feeding within hours" or activating the next day after impact, significantly outpacing traditional responses. This rapid mobilization is crucial when Red Cross staffing is constrained or logistical chains are delayed. Specific examples of this same-day or next-day activation include:
• During Hurricane Francine (DR 207-25), two hyper-local partners began providing hot meals by dinner on the day the storm passed, and two library locations were running as cooling and charging centers within 24 hours of landfall.
• In the Madison County tornadoes, church coalitions activated within 24 hours, which not only sped up service but also increased Immediate Assistance (IA) uptake.
• In one instance during the Tennessee Tornados (DR 540-25), a partner team was on site distributing emergency kits within hours of being contacted.
• Community stakeholder interviews from September 2025 documented same-day distributions and multi-day service continuity during Hurricanes Helene and Milton, with late-night hotel placements and sustained medical outreach that stakeholders contrasted favorably with prior disasters.

This speed advantage is also quantifiable in the delivery of Disaster Emergency Supplies (DES). A comparative analysis across several DROs shows that CAP partners delivered the first DES services 1 to 4 days faster than Red Cross efforts in the top-damaged counties. For example:
• Kentucky Floods (DR 539-25): Partners were four days faster.
• Tennessee Tornados (DR 540-25): Partners were three days faster.
• FLOCOM (DR 220-25), South Texas Floods (DR 503-25), and MO/AR Storms (DR 535-25): Partners were one day faster.
• Hurricane Francine (DR 207-25): Partners were active on the same day.

This rapid response is enabled by local assets, such as CAP-funded box trucks, vans, and pre-positioned supplies, which allow partners to bypass logistical delays. A DRO staff member noted the seamlessness of this collaboration: "It was almost like they went in with us together. There was no call up—we just went."

"Halo Effect" (Steady State Impacts): Beyond its critical role in disaster response, the Community Adaptation Program (CAP) generates a significant "Halo Effect" by enhancing the Red Cross's mission, reputation, and community resilience during non-disaster, or "steady-state," periods. This "blue-sky" work focuses on foundational activities like coalition-building and establishing rural trust, which has captured the particular interest of senior leadership. The presence of CAP teams in communities creates positive spillover effects for various daily Red Cross operations.

Key impacts of this Halo Effect include:
• Coalition Building and Community Trust: A core success of CAP is its ability to build coalitions and help "connect the dots" between diverse local partners, including churches and grassroots organizations. This fosters community resilience and establishes a trusted local presence for the Red Cross before disasters strike, which is especially crucial in rural areas where connections might otherwise be difficult to forge during a major event. This groundwork has built credibility for the Red Cross because of CAP.
• Volunteer Engagement: Although not an initial program goal, CAP has positively influenced volunteerism. Quantitative analysis comparing the period before CAP (FY20-FY22) to the period with CAP (FY23-FY25) reveals that CAP jurisdictions experienced a +35.92% increase in average annual total volunteers, which is significantly higher than the national average increase of +16.05%. This suggests that a local CAP presence fosters increased community engagement.
• Community Preparedness and Safety: CAP's localized engagement directly contributes to improved community safety and preparedness outcomes. Data shows that "Homes Made Safer" initiatives in CAP jurisdictions increased by +66.24%, substantially outpacing the national average increase of +14.02%. Similarly, youth preparedness outreach saw a +101.23% increase in CAP jurisdictions, compared to the national average of +39.13%.
• Averting Brand Risk: An often unseen but critical impact is CAP's role in mitigating brand risk. In FY25, CAP partners were instrumental in resolving or preventing 12 service delivery failures on Level 3+ DROs. This local, responsive network acts as a crucial buffer, helping to avert negative public perception and media coverage for the Red Cross.
• Partner Capacity: The program's value is also reflected in the partners' own assessment of their improved capabilities. An overwhelming 97% of partners report that CAP improved their ability to serve those impacted by a disaster.

Recent stakeholder interviews emphasize CAP's role as a strategic convener, aligning nonprofit, government, and national actors while providing critical blue-skies resources. The September 2025 analysis highlights the importance of formalizing MOUs, institutionalizing liaison systems, and securing predictable funding for blue-skies assets.

Scalability Potential: While the current dedicated three-person CAP team model is not sustainable nationwide, the evaluation identifies key tactics and principles that are replicable and adaptable for integration into broader Red Cross chapter and regional operations. These include relationship-building, leveraging local credibility, and developing sustainable staffing models for partnership management. September 2025 analysis highlights the importance of formalizing MOUs, institutionalizing liaison systems, and securing predictable funding for blue-skies assets.

Overall Recommendation: CAP should be continued and strategically adapted as a force multiplier for disaster operations and community mobilization, emphasizing partner trust, demonstrated ROI, and network effects. Future efforts should focus on integrating CAP's successful tactics into the wider Red Cross structure to maximize impact and reach across the country.
